#Write a function called search_inside_files. search_inside_files
#should have two parameters: a filename and a string to search for.
#search_inside_files should return a list of line numbers as integers
#where the string appeared. Note that the string at that index does
#not need to BE the search string, but rather must just contain it.
#You should assume that the first line in a file is line 1, not line
#0.
#
#For example, if the files contents was:
#cat
#cats
#dog
#dogs
#catsup
#
#Then search_inside_files("input_file.txt", "cat") would return
#[1, 2, 5], because "cat" appears on lines 1, 2, and 5.
#
#Make sure the list you return is sorted from lowest line number to
#highest.


#Add your code here!

#[2, 5]
#[5]
